Description: A flexible package for the estimation of population
    attributable fractions (PAFs), with the ability to consider
    external prevalence estimates. The flexibility in this package
    arises largely from its modular structure allowing PAFs to be
    calculated in two stages. The first stage involves model fitting
    and risk estimation. The second stage uses risk estimates and
    prevalences to calculate a PAF.
